# hotel-project
Final Project for CSCI Java class at ETSU.

This project has multiple files to simulate a hotel.
The user can put guests into rooms, view information of guests, and calculate the expected income of the hotel.

This project demonstrates the use of multiple classes and files. It also is an
example of object-oriented programming from the hotel spaces and guest information.
